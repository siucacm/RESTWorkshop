# WorkshopFour
Welcome, we will be talking about RESTful web services and API's in general

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siucacm/WorkshopFour
chmod u+x getjoke.sh
```

Run it

```bash
./getjoke.sh
```

This was possible due to many factors one of which is Representational state transfer.

## REST 
REST is an architectural style and is heavily used by web services to communicate.
Designed by Roy Fielding in his PhD dissertation.
It has the following constraints:
* Client-Server architectural style
* Stateless
* Cacheable
* Layered system
* Uniform interface
* Code on demand (optional)

<hr>

## HTTP
HTTP is a protocol.
Important methods:
* GET : Request a resource
* HEAD : Request a resource but no body
* PUT/POST : Adding a resource
* DELETE : Delete a resource

Important status codes:

1. 200 = OKay
2. 404 = Not found

Anything 400 is client side error
Anything 500 is server side error

There are some arguments between PUT and POST about which one is used for what :)

<hr>

```bash
GET http://stackoverflow.com/

```

Now check a summary

```bash
HEAD http://stackoverflow.com/
```

Try any random website and see what you get.


These are websites but there has to be some sort of an Application program interfaces to used

## API
API : Set of protocols,tools for building software. Java API (Sounds familiar?)

```java
//The below uses javas api
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

<hr>
## RESTful API's
Fetch resources using HTTP

Type in browser:
http://quotes.rest/qod.json?category=inspire

Keep on fully refreshing the page.
After a while, you will get what is called a rate limit.
This prevents people for misusing restful services.

Lets have a look at the API docs here [theysaidso.com](https://theysaidso.com/api/#qod)


```bash
#Run script below
./getip.sh
```

You just made GET requests to ipify's API requesting a resource.
You may have noticed all of this objects we get are wrapped in braces etc


#### ITS JSON :)

<hr>

### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation is a data-interchange format.
Its like a dictionary for those familiar with python.
Learn more at [JSON.org](http://www.json.org/)

<hr>

### Authentication
```
GET http://api.wordnik.com/v4/words.json/wordOfTheDay
```

Sometimes, you need an <b> API KEY </b> to make requests

<b> Never leave your API KEY hanging about in a publically accessible domain. Its dangerous :) </b>

Instead,export it as an environment variable or throw it in a config file.

```bash
export KEY="secretkey"

echo $KEY
```

<hr>

Sometimes, it can be hard to read a gigantic response like here:

```bash
GET http://api.wordnik.com/v4/words.json
```

We have some tools for that

```bash
#Python ships with a tool to pretty print json object
#The line is a pipe which pipes output of command 1 to input of command 2
GET http://api.wordnik.com/v4/words.json | python -m json.tool
```

Notice how its still a large object.
Good guy UNIX ships with some tools that can be handy:

```bash
#Go through file slowly
GET http://api.wordnik.com/v4/words.json | python -m json.tool | less 

#head and tail are your friends
```

<hr>

### Lets get even more hands on

Lets POST some data!
Firebase (Backend as a service) allows us to have a database which can be modified through HTTP.

```bash
GET https://rest-1663a.firebaseio.com/.json | python -m json.tool

###POST https://rest-1663a.firebaseio.com/.json
### Now enter your object as {"NAME":"LANGUAGE PROFICIENT IN}
### Press CTRL D and give it a couple of seconds.
### Something should pop up in your screen

GET https://rest-1663a.firebaseio.com/.json

#You should see your data

```
<b>You can modify authentication to change options on who can get and post data. </b>

A small practical use
```bash

java -jar APIGetReq.jar
#Type in http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en

```

Want to learn more? Have a look at the source code and tweak it to display any json object.
